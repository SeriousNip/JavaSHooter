# JavaSHooter
A top down shooter created in java one year ago when I was learning how to use event handlers and how to generate objects automatically.

This was made using the InteliJ IDE. It uses an engine made by me similar to the one in Minecraft when it first came out. The map is generated using a picture stored localy.
Most of the assets used in this game were taken from itch.io since i do not have the experience and skill to create them.'

The game still needs a lot of work mainly on the enemy AI since now instead of going after the player, they just twitch in place.
